# React Development Rules  

## General Guidelines  
- Start conversation emoji 😎
- Be meticulous in your implementation—don't write code unless you're **100% confident** in your approach.  
- Maintain **backward compatibility** whenever possible.  
- Keep code **simple and minimal**—fewer lines are better.  
- Avoid unnecessary replacements; only change something if it's truly better, and explain **why**.  
- Aim for **minimal changes during code reviews**.  

---

### Package Management  
- **We use `pnpm`, not `npm`**—always follow this rule for package installations.  

### TypeScript Guidelines  
- **Do not** use `any` type annotation.  
- Use `unknown` **only if** the type is truly unknown.  
- Prefer **strict type annotations** for clarity and maintainability.  

### Development Principles  
- Follow the **Principle of Least Surprise**—keep your code intuitive and do things the obvious way.  
- Maintain **consistency** in coding style and structure.

# Shadcn UI Components

This project uses @shadcn/ui for UI components. These are beautifully designed, accessible components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

## Finding and Using Components

Components are available in the `src/components/ui` directory, following the aliases configured in `components.json`

## Using Components

Import components from the ui directory using the configured aliases:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Tabs, TabsContent, TabsList, TabsTrigger } from "@/components/ui/tabs"
import { Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardFooter, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"
```

Example usage:

```tsx
<Button variant="outline">Click me</Button>

<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Card Title</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>Card Description</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <p>Card Content</p>
  </CardContent>
  <CardFooter>
    <p>Card Footer</p>
  </CardFooter>
</Card>
```

## Installing Additional Components

Many more components are available but not currently installed. You can view the complete list at https://ui.shadcn.com/r

To install additional components, use the Shadcn CLI:


```bash
npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
```

For example, to add the Accordion component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion
```

Note: `npx shadcn-ui@latest` is deprecated, use `npx shadcn@latest` instead

Some commonly used components are

- Accordion
- Alert
- AlertDialog
- AspectRatio
- Avatar
- Calendar
- Checkbox
- Collapsible
- Command
- ContextMenu
- DataTable
- DatePicker
- Dropdown Menu
- Form
- Hover Card
- Menubar
- Navigation Menu
- Popover
- Progress
- Radio Group
- ScrollArea
- Select
- Separator
- Sheet
- Skeleton
- Slider
- Switch
- Table
- Textarea
- Toast
- Toggle
- Tooltip

## Component Styling

This project uses the "new-york" style variant with the "neutral" base color and CSS variables for theming, as configured in `components.json`.

By following these rules, we ensure clean, maintainable, and production-ready React code.
