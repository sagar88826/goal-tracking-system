# Goal-Tracking Web Application Development Plan

## Overview

This project aims to develop a goal-tracking web application that helps users achieve personal and professional goals by breaking down a total required time into daily, weekly, and monthly tasks. The app will feature graphical progress indicators that compare planned, actual, and delayed progress.

---

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements and Planning

- **Define Goals and Scope**
  - Multiple goals per user.
  - Each goal includes:
    - A target (e.g., complete a book in 100 hours).
    - A deadline.
    - A breakdown of required effort (daily, weekly, monthly).
  
- **User Stories**
  - As a user, I can create, edit, and delete goals.
  - As a user, I can log progress against each goal.
  - As a user, I can view graphical representations of my progress.
  - As a user, I receive notifications/reminders to log progress.

- **Tech Stack Decision**
  - Frontend: React/Angular/Vue (depending on team preference).
  - Backend: Node.js/Express, Django, or similar.
  - Database: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.
  - Graphing: Chart.js, D3.js, or similar libraries.
  - Notification Service: Email or in-app notifications.

### Phase 2: MVP Development

#### 1. Goal Creation Module
- **Features:**
  - Form for users to add a new goal with:
    - Title and description.
    - Total required time (e.g., 100 hours).
    - Deadline.
    - Optionally, a suggested breakdown (daily, weekly, monthly time allotments).
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/goals` – Create a new goal.
  - `GET /api/goals` – Retrieve all user goals.
  - `PUT /api/goals/:id` – Update an existing goal.
  - `DELETE /api/goals/:id` – Delete a goal.

#### 2. Progress Tracking Module
- **Features:**
  - Allow users to log daily or weekly progress (time spent).
  - Automatically calculate progress:
    - Planned progress based on target and deadline.
    - Actual progress from logged entries.
    - Projection of delay if behind schedule.
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/progress` – Log progress for a goal.
  - `GET /api/progress/:goalId` – Retrieve progress for a given goal.

#### 3. Graphical Representation Module
- **Features:**
  - **Individual Goal View:**
    - Graph showing:
      - **Planned Progress Line**: Ideal timeline based on deadline.
      - **Actual Progress Line**: Based on logged entries.
      - **Delayed Progress Line**: Projection if behind schedule.
  - **Dashboard View:**
    - Combined graph overview of all goals.
    - Use different colors or markers to represent each goal.
- **Tools/Libraries:**
  - Integrate a charting library (Chart.js, D3.js, etc.) for rendering graphs.

#### 4. Notification & Reminder Module
- **Features:**
  - Set up notifications to remind users to log progress.
  - Optionally, email notifications or in-app alerts.
- **Integration:**
  - Use a scheduled job or cron-like system on the server.

---

### Phase 3: Testing and Iteration

- **Unit Testing:**
  - Write tests for API endpoints and core functions (goal creation, progress calculations).
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Ensure that the frontend, backend, and database work seamlessly together.
- **User Acceptance Testing:**
  - Validate that the graphical representation is accurate and user-friendly.
  - Gather feedback on the overall user experience.

---

### Phase 4: Future Enhancements

#### 1. Goal Categories
- **Feature:**
  - Allow users to categorize goals (e.g., Personal, Professional, Fitness).

#### 2. Progress Insights & Recommendations
- **Feature:**
  - Analyze user trends and provide motivational tips or suggestions.
  - Optionally, add AI-driven recommendations for improving progress.

#### 3. Social Features
- **Feature:**
  - Enable users to share their progress or goals with friends.
  - Potential integration with leaderboards or community features.

---

## Deployment & Maintenance

- **Deployment:**
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployment.
  - Ensure environment variables and secrets management.
- **Monitoring:**
  - Implement logging and performance monitoring.
  - Use error tracking tools to capture and fix issues post-deployment.
- **Maintenance:**
  - Regularly update dependencies and libraries.
  - Plan for scalability and future feature additions.

---

## Documentation & Handoff

- Provide clear documentation on:
  - API endpoints.
  - UI component structure.
  - Database schema.
  - Notification configuration.
- Include a README with setup instructions and a guide for developers to extend the MVP.
